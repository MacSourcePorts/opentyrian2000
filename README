OpenTyrian2000
================================================================================

OpenTyrian2000 is an open-source port of the DOS game Tyrian. It is a fork of
OpenTyrian, with the end goal being to replicate the experience of Tyrian 2000
as closely as possible.

Tyrian is an arcade-style vertical scrolling shooter.  The story is set
in 20,031 where you play as Trent Hawkins, a skilled fighter-pilot employed
to fight MicroSol and save the galaxy.

Tyrian features a story mode, one- and two-player arcade modes, and networked
multiplayer.

== Additional Necessary Files ==================================================

OpenTyrian2000 requires the Tyrian 2000 data files, which have been released
as freeware:

== Keyboard Controls ===========================================================

ctrl-backspace -- kill OpenTyrian2000
alt-enter      -- fullscreen
ctrl-f10       -- ungrab mouse

arrow keys     -- ship movement
space          -- fire weapons
enter          -- toggle rear weapon mode
ctrl/alt       -- fire left/right sidekick

== Network Multiplayer =========================================================

Currently OpenTyrian2000 does not have an arena; as such, networked games must
be initiated manually via the command line simultaneously by both players.

syntax:
  opentyrian2000 --net HOSTNAME --net-player-name NAME --net-player-number NUM

where HOSTNAME is the IP address of your opponent, NUM is either 1 or 2
depending on which ship you intend to pilot, and NAME is your alias

OpenTyrian2000 uses UDP port 1333 for multiplayer, but in most cases players
will not need to open any ports because OpenTyrian2000 makes use of UDP hole
punching.

Note that Network play has not been tested for OpenTyrian2000.
